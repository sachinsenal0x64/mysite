/**
 * Allows you to split or normalize the cache space for a given route. Common use cases include:
 *
 * - serving multiple variants of the same URL based on a currency and/or language cookie.
 * - caching different responses based on device type
 * - ignoring all but a specific set of query parameters when looking up a response from the cache.
 *
 * **Example**
 *
 * ```js
 *  import { Router, CustomCacheKey } from '@edgio/core/router'
 *
 *  new Router()
 *    .match('/some-path', ({ cache }) => {
 *      cache({
 *        key: new CustomCacheKey()
 *          .excludeAllQueryParametersExcept('color', 'size')
 *          .addCookie('currency')
 *          .addDevice()
 *        edge: {
 *          maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60
 *        }
 *      })
 *    })
 * ```
