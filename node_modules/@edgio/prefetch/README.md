# Edgio Prefetch

Prefetching library for the [Edgio](https://docs.edg.io), infrastructure to run your big, dynamic website frontend and make it load in less than one second.

The `@edgio/prefetch` package makes it easy to prefetch dynamic content cached at the network edge and store it in the browser's service worker cache.

You can read more about it in our [prefetching guide](https://docs.edg.io/guides/prefetching)
