## ðŸ‘¤ Who I Am

I'm yet another backend developer, obsessed with [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call). So I believe everything should be free as a free speech without any restrictions & gatekeeping. That's why I developed free & open source software and mainly use Go & Python. In short, I attended university but ended up dropping out, as it proved utterly worthless to me  I attended university but ended up dropping out after 2 years, as it proved utterly worthless to me, So I've taken numerous online classes / books also obtained ICCA cloud [certification](https://certs.ine.com/7bb6bdb9-d509-4ab9-a46a-0143271d89b6) from [ine.com](https://ine.com) Additionally, I've learned a lot from open source and have been self-learning for a significant amount of time ðŸ“– as well as i follow philosophy. So I created [Fixarr](https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/fixarr) because I couldn't find any free Movie & TV renamer when I searched for one. Most available options were paid, and some open-source tools weren't functioning properly. Hence, I felt compelled to create a free and open-source solution.
