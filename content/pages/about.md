## ðŸ‘¤ Who I Am

I'm a privately passionate open-source backend developer, obsessed with cloud computing (end of the day i can host my own media server remotely lmao). so i believe everything should be free as a free speech without any restrictions & gatekeeping. In short, i attended university but ended up resigning, as it proved utterly worthless to me. I've taken numerous online classes / books also obtained ICCA cloud [certification](https://certs.ine.com/7bb6bdb9-d509-4ab9-a46a-0143271d89b6) from [ine.com](https://www.ine.com) Additionally, I've learned a lot from open source and have been self-learning for a significant amount of time ðŸ“– as well as i follow philosophy. So I created [Fixarr](https://github.com/sachinsenal0x64/FIXARR) because I couldn't find any free Movie & TV renamer when I searched for one. Most available options were paid, and some open-source tools weren't functioning properly. Hence, I felt compelled to create a free and open-source solution.
