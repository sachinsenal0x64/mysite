## ðŸ‘¤ Who I Am

I'm a passionate open-source backend developer, obsessed with cloud computing. In short, I attended university but ended up resigning, as it proved utterly worthless for me. I've taken numerous online classes and obtained ICCA cloud [certification](https://certs.ine.com/7bb6bdb9-d509-4ab9-a46a-0143271d89b6) from ine.com. Additionally, I've learned a lot from open source and have been self-learning for a significant amount of time ðŸ“–. I created FIXARR because I couldn't find any free Movie & TV renamer when I searched for one. Most available options were paid, and some open-source tools weren't functioning properly. Hence, I felt compelled to create a free and open-source solution.
